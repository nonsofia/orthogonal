  due to a complex of historical and cultural factors, the absolute and pure
  visual forms reached by malewicz and mondrian in the early 1910s have almost no
  influence on bulgarian modern art. hence, one may well argue that bulgarian
  modernism is deprived of its natural integrity without a consciously held
  non-objective period.
</p>

<p>
  a prerequisite for the emergence of non-objective tendencies within the local
  art context can be found in the maturation of contemporary bulgarian civil
  society. on the other hand, this is an interactive process in which civil
  society is the principal beneficiary of the promotion of non-objective art
  forms. examples of such successful collaboration between society and
  non-objective aesthetics can be observed in countries like the netherlands,
  germany, france and switzerland, as well as in societies much closer to our
  political fate like poland, hungary, the czech republic and romania, where
  constructive and conceptual traditions date back to several decades ago.

  conceived as an international forum, orthogonal brings together and presents a
  selection of artists and theoreticians who work in the field of non-objective
  and constructive art. apart from an exhibition of art–µfacts the event offers a
  programme of open lectures and screenings which deal with contemporary and
  historical issues of this little known, in bulgaria, art movement. in 2014 we
  launched the forum's most important module - <em>orthogonal for children</em> - a 2-hour
  workshop for kids between 5 and 11. <a href="http://nonsofia.org">nonsofia</a>'s
  ambition is that orthogonal remains a regular art festival which will expand in the
  future and stay permanently on the bulgarian cultural agenda.

  orthogonal's fourth edition will take place between 21 september and 3 november
  2018 at <a href="http://kunsthaus-rehau.de/Index_ie.htm">ikkp / kunsthaus rehau</a>,
  germany. historically, this is the first group show of bulgarian geometric art
  abroad. the exhibition will present the work of 9 bulgarian artists of all
  generations since modern times till present day. it will include oil painting,
  drawing, animation, collage and serigraphy. you are welcome to enquire further
