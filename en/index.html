  due to a complex of historical and cultural factors, the absolute and pure
  visual forms reached by malewicz and mondrian in the early 1910s have almost
  no influence on bulgarian modern art. should we exclude the achievements of
  georges papazoff and nikolay diulgheroff, who left the country in their
  twenties, and also the apocryphal stylisations of peter dochev and georgi
  yanakiev, one may well argue that bulgarian modernism is deprived of its
  natural integrity without a consciously held non-objective period.

  a prerequisite for the emergence of non-objective tendencies within the local
  art context can be found in the maturation of contemporary bulgarian civil
  society. on the other hand, this is a mutual process in which civil society
  is the principal beneficiary of the promotion of non-objective art forms.
  examples of such successful collaboration between society and non-objective
  aesthetics can be observed in countries like the netherlands, germany, france
  and switzerland, as well as in societies much closer to our political fate
  like poland, hungary, the czech republic and romania, where constructive and
  conceptual traditions date back to several decades ago.

  conceived as an international forum in 2011, orthogonal will introduce the
  bulgarian cultural public to a number of leading contemporary artists and
  theoreticians, who work in the field of non-objective art.  apart from an
  exhibition of a variety of artifacts (e.g. painting, graphic art,
  photography, text, relief and video art) the event will offer a programme of
  open lectures and screenings which deal with contemporary and historical
  issues of this yet little known here art movement. the ambition of the
  organiser is that this forum becomes a regular art festival which will expand
  in the future and remain permanently on the bulgarian cultural agenda.
