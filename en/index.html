  due to a complex of historical and cultural factors, the absolute and pure
  visual forms reached by malewicz and mondrian in the early 1910s have almost no
  influence on bulgarian modern art. hence, one may well argue that bulgarian
  modernism is deprived of its natural integrity without a consciously held
  non-objective period.
</p>

<p>
  a prerequisite for the emergence of non-objective tendencies within the local
  art context can be found in the maturation of contemporary bulgarian civil
  society. on the other hand, this is an interactive process in which civil
  society is the principal beneficiary of the promotion of non-objective art
  forms. examples of such successful collaboration between society and
  non-objective aesthetics can be observed in countries like the netherlands,
  germany, france and switzerland, as well as in societies much closer to our
  political fate like poland, hungary, the czech republic and romania, where
  constructive and conceptual traditions date back to several decades ago.

  conceived as an international forum, orthogonal introduced the bulgarian
  cultural public to a number of contemporary artists and theoreticians, who work
  in the field of non-objective art. apart from an exhibition of a variety of
  artifacts the event offered a programme of open lectures and screenings which
  dealt with contemporary and historical issues of this yet little known here art
  movement. <a href="http://nonsofia.com">nonsofia</a>'s ambition is that this forum becomes a regular art festival
  which will expand in the future and remain permanently on the bulgarian
  cultural agenda.

  at the <a href="http://www.redhouse-sofia.org">red house centre for culture and debate</a>, sofia. the forum’s opening was
